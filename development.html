            <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
            <p>Over the past few years, my priority when it comes to learning in the computer science subject has been to build a skillset that will serve me well both in industry in the future as well as stand me in good stead to seek freelance opportunities as well. As such I have put a lot of time into learning the skills of a jack-of-all-trades web and software developer.</p>
            <p>This journey has taken me from learning basic front-end web development, to programming in high-level languages, UI/UX design, to now learning back-end development, "vibe coding" and even lesser-known parts of the subject such as low-level languages, embedded systems programming and quantum computers.</p>
            <h2>Web Design & Development</h2>
            <img src="media-assets/web-dev-photo.png" alt="A screenshot of one of Lee's website designs">
            <p>Where it all began for me and one of the areas that I'm still most passionate about, I have about 5 years of experience in designing and building websites using a variety of web development tools.</p>
            <p>I am highly proficient in HTML5 and CSS3 as well as vanilla JavaScript - those three core technologies forming the foundation of basic website design & development. I also have some experience in using "what you see is what you get" (or WYSIWYG) editors and Content Management Systems (CMS) such as WordPress, where I have some experience building websites both using pre-built themes and plugins as well as some basic experience in designing my own themes using PHP.</p>
            <p>Most of my web projects so far have been personal projects, making websites about my interests. However, I am eager to continue to grow my skills and build websites for other people and organisations. I am also excited to be beginning my journey into back-end web development using Node, Express and MongoDB. I would also like to learn more in the realm of JavaScript frameworks such as React, Next and Nuxt.</p>
            <h2>Programming & Software Development</h2>
            <img src="media-assets/software-dev-photo.png" alt="A screenshot of one of Lee's software developement projects - a UI-powered personal diary app written in Python">
            <p>My journey in software development started a little later when I started college a year and a half ago, where I learned the basics of programming in beginner-friendly programming languages such as Python and C#. I enjoyed Python in particular for it's versatility, and as such I would consider myself to be a fairly competent Python programmer. The screenshot of the "diary" app to the right-hand-side is the main menu of a personal diary app that I wrote in Python, using a GUI framework called Tkinter.</p>
            <p>I also know some JavaScript, which is crucial for web development, and I am currently learning more C# as well as some entry-level Java concepts. I have some ideas for web and mobile applications that I want to develop in the near future and as such I expect my passion and expertise in the area of software development to only grow over time.</p>
