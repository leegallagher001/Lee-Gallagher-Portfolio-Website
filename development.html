            <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
            <p>Over the past few years, my priority when it comes to learning in the computer science subject has been to build a skillset that will serve me well both in industry in the future as well as stand me in good stead to seek freelance opportunities as well. As such I have put a lot of time into learning the skills of a jack-of-all-trades web and software developer.</p>
            <p>This journey has taken me from learning basic front-end web development, to programming in high-level languages, UI/UX design, to now learning back-end development, "vibe coding" and even lesser-known parts of the subject such as low-level languages, embedded systems programming and quantum computers.</p>
            <h2>Web Design & Development</h2>
            <img src="media-assets/web-dev-photo.png" alt="A screenshot of one of Lee's website designs">
            <p>Where it all began for me and one of the areas that I'm still most passionate about, I have about 5 years of experience in designing and building websites using a variety of web development tools.</p>
            <p>I am highly proficient in HTML5 and CSS3 as well as vanilla JavaScript - those three core technologies forming the foundation of basic website design & development. I also have some experience in using "what you see is what you get" (or WYSIWYG) editors and Content Management Systems (CMS) such as WordPress, where I have some experience building websites both using pre-built themes and plugins as well as some basic experience in designing my own themes using PHP.</p>
            <p>Most of my web projects so far have been personal projects, making websites about my interests. However, I am eager to continue to grow my skills and build websites for other people and organisations. I am also excited to be beginning my journey into back-end web development using Node, Express and MongoDB. I would also like to learn more in the realm of JavaScript frameworks such as React, Next and Nuxt.</p>
            <h2>Programming & Software Development</h2>
            <img src="media-assets/software-dev-photo.png" alt="A screenshot of one of Lee's software developement projects - a UI-powered personal diary app written in Python">
            <p>My journey in software development started a little later when I started college a year and a half ago, where I learned the basics of programming in beginner-friendly programming languages such as Python and C#. I enjoyed Python in particular for it's versatility, and as such I would consider myself to be a fairly competent Python programmer. The screenshot of the "diary" app to the right-hand-side is the main menu of a personal diary app that I wrote in Python, using a GUI framework called Tkinter.</p>
            <p>I also know some JavaScript, which is crucial for web development, and I am currently learning more C# as well as some entry-level Java concepts. I have some ideas for web and mobile applications that I want to develop in the near future and as such I expect my passion and expertise in the area of software development to only grow over time, with my ultimate end goal being to become a software engineer professionally.</p>
            <h2>Electronics & Embedded Systems</h2>
            <p>My interest in computers and digital systems extends beyond software too. From a young age I was always interested in aviation, space and robotics, and so I've recently began exploring basic electronics as well. I started off simple with the BBC micro:bit, a very beginner-friendly but nonetheless interesting board that allowed me an easy entry into the field of electronics. It can be programmed in "Blocks", a Scratch-like drap and drop language, as well as MicroPython, a type of Python used in embedded systems and electronics.</p>
            <p>I also have some basic experience with other more advanced boards such as the Arduino UNO and the Raspberry Pi Pico H. For the Pico, I have used MicroPython to do some basic things, but with the Arduino UNO I have taken my first steps into C++ programming. I would like to continue to learn C and C++, as these remain the standard for embedded systems and low-level (close to hardware) work.</p>
            <p>Overall, I am still very new to hardware and electronics, but I'm very excited to continue to learn more as I continue to practice with them.</p>
            <h2>Vibe Coding & AI Development</h2>
            <img src="media-assets/vibe-coding-photo.png" alt="A photo of 'Aetheria Chronicles' - a visual text adventure game that Lee 'vibe-coded' using Google AI Studio">
            <p>As a general rule, I DO NOT use AI in my journey to learn programming and software development. However, it is nonetheless a tool that will continue to be with us from now on, and as such I have began attending a local meetup group where for a couple of hours at a time I allow myself to build projects using Google AI Studio. I have to admit, it is an impressive and powerful tool, and whilst I wouldn't want it to replace a good understanding of the fundamentals of software programming and engineering, I can see its benefits clearly.</p>
            <p>As time goes, I'm sure I'll become wiser and learn better how to integrate the use of AI into projects that I do in the future, as I do believe that it will be a big part of software engineering & development - indeed, I have heard as much from people who are in the industry already. It is also good to keep up with current trends - which is perhaps more important in the Computer Science field than in almost any other - and as such, whilst I wouldn't want to be over-reliant on any one tool, I would likely be wise not to ignore it. I guess my ultimate vision would be to be a "vibe-assisted" or "AI-partnered" developer - having the AI be a loyal wingman to my own vision and battle plan.</p>
